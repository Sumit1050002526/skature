                <h2>Welcome,<br>
                    I'm Omamerhi.</h2>
                <p>Following my year abroad in 2017-18 in Spain and Ecuador, I always wanted the ability to travel and
                    work
                    remotely, whether I wanted to stay in London or go abroad, I simply wanted the option to CHOOSE.</p>

                <p>After working remotely teaching English to Chinese students at the age of 19, my mindset was
                    completely shifted
                    by the world of remote work. I truly experienced the power of the Internet to transfer talent,
                    knowledge and value across
                    the globe. Since then, I have created projects remotely and successfully completed Le
                    Wagon coding bootcamp and now do freelance web design and development.</p>

                <p>Having studied in the UK, China and Ecuador, completed the Landmark Forum, and attended the Vipassana
                    10 day silent
                    meditation retreat; I have a unique, holistic, evolving view of the world and just how powerful we
                    are as
                    individuals to create opportunities for ourselves and even moreso with the Internet.</p>

                <h2>"Common Pitfalls to Avoid in College Teacher Training"....</h2>
                <p>In the realm of college teacher training, several common pitfalls can hinder the effectiveness of the
                    training process. These pitfalls include passive learning, where educators merely absorb information
                    without active engagement; ignoring valuable feedback from instructors and peers; being overly rigid
                    in teaching approaches, which may not suit diverse student needs; overlooking the integration of
                    technology, a vital component in modern education; and neglecting the practice of self-reflection,
                    which is crucial for personal growth and refinement of teaching methods.</p>
                <p>Additionally, teachers sometimes fail to acknowledge diverse learning styles and abilities in their
                    students, miss out on the benefits of collaboration and networking with peers, resist embracing
                    innovative teaching methods, and forget to apply what they've learned in the actual classroom.
                    Finally, not heeding student feedback can be a significant oversight, as it offers valuable insights
                    into teaching effectiveness.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>College teacher training is a crucial component of professional development in higher education, and
                    understanding the essential steps in this process can significantly enhance an educator's
                    effectiveness in the classroom.</p>
                <p>First and foremost, active participation is key. Educators should engage fully in training sessions,
                    ask questions, and contribute to discussions to ensure they absorb and internalize the knowledge
                    being shared. Furthermore, seeking and embracing feedback from instructors and peers is essential.
                    Constructive criticism can highlight areas for improvement and lead to more effective teaching
                    practices.</p>
